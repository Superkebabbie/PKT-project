		/* A word from the author:
		 * The code provided here was made kind of hastily and experimentally, and now at the end we
		 * look back and think "dang, that is some confusing code". This is what you'll get as our
		 * prototype, but we'll likely rewrite most of this at some point. There are also several TODO-
		 * markers spread out over the code that indicate some sort of suboptimal solution which still have to
		 * be corrected. And - not a small point - we planned on making a backward chaining algorithm but
		 * kind of accidentally made a forward one, which we will keep for now as we discovered that backward
		 * chaining will require a bit more thought. The important thing is that now the prototype is finished
		 * we have developed a good or at least better idea of how the whole system should work.
		 * 
		 * The code below uses manual construction of a knowledge base and gives that to the solveEngine. The
		 * idea is to automate this from XML, but that we did not have time for yet. It does however export the
		 * tree that the solver constructs to JSON which will be readable by the website; this output is printed
		 * to the console as well as saved to test.txt (see below). To make a bit clearer how we construct the
		 * knowledge base everything below has been commented when it is first used, we hope that will help you
		 * understand.
